    "Description": "The Momentum 4 earbuds have a keen focus on sound quality, most notably now supporting Qualcomm’s AptX Lossless technology, which delivers high-quality, lossless audio when paired with your phone, tablet, smart TV or laptop.\n\nIntroduced to the public in 2021, aptX Lossless is an audio technology that allows for the transmission of high-quality audio wirelessly, maintaining the original audio quality when streaming or transmitting audio over Bluetooth connections. The audio you hear through the Momentum 4 therefore retains its fidelity and richness similar to how it was recorded, offering a near-CD quality experience without the need for cables.\n\nThe new Sennheiser Momentum 4 true wireless earbuds support Bluetooth LE audio and Auracast, so you can connect your earbuds to an unlimited number of devices. They also offer adaptive noise cancellation for an immersive listening experience.\n\nIn terms of battery life, Momentum 4 offer up to 7.5 hours from the earbuds themselves, extendable up to 30 hours with the charging case, rivalling top-tier competitors such as the Sony WF-1000XM5.\n\n[https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/momentum-true-wireless-4](https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/momentum-true-wireless-4)",

Mild EQing helps them a lot.  Excellent ANC.  Wings keep them firmly in place during all activities.  Small case, small buds, fit nicely inside the ear.  Touch controls could be a little more responsive.  No app.  Really nice set of buds.\n\nEl Jefe review - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY8VBdCzTtQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY8VBdCzTtQ)\n\nGamesky review - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwQlVMmMCBw&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwQlVMmMCBw&t=2s)",
