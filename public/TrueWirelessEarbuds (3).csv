"Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4","The Momentum 4 earbuds have a keen focus on sound quality, most notably now supporting Qualcomm’s AptX Lossless technology, which delivers high-quality, lossless audio when paired with your phone, tablet, smart TV or laptop.

Introduced to the public in 2021, aptX Lossless is an audio technology that allows for the transmission of high-quality audio wirelessly, maintaining the original audio quality when streaming or transmitting audio over Bluetooth connections. The audio you hear through the Momentum 4 therefore retains its fidelity and richness similar to how it was recorded, offering a near-CD quality experience without the need for cables.

The new Sennheiser Momentum 4 true wireless earbuds support Bluetooth LE audio and Auracast, so you can connect your earbuds to an unlimited number of devices. They also offer adaptive noise cancellation for an immersive listening experience.

In terms of battery life, Momentum 4 offer up to 7.5 hours from the earbuds themselves, extendable up to 30 hours with the charging case, rivalling top-tier competitors such as the Sony WF-1000XM5.

"Edifier X3 (Plus)","These are identical to the `Edifier X3 TO-U`, except for the color and icons on the buds. However, they are *not* the same as the original X3, as they have a USB-C port and IP55 instead of IPX5. These used to be sold as the X3 Plus, but now they're just call the X3 on Edifier's site.

Comes in white or black.

Touch controls for the music, physical buttons on the edge for the ANC.  Great design!  App support, customizable controls, very good ANC.  A little large in the ear.  Easy to remove from the case.  Mics could be better.

Excellent sound, but a bit bass-heavy.  Mild EQing helps them a lot.  Excellent ANC.  Wings keep them firmly in place during all activities.  Small case, small buds, fit nicely inside the ear.  Touch controls could be a little more responsive.  No app.  Really nice set of buds.

"LG TONE Free T90","Has a audio retransmission feature, by connecting the included usb-c to 3.5mm cable to the case.

The LG TONE Free T90 includes a convenient UVnano+ charging case that harnesses the power of UV-C light (also called germicidal UV) to refresh the earbuds’ eargels. It effectively kills 99.9% bacteria on the eargels of the earbuds during the powered charging cycle.
